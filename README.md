This repository contains a simple web application built with React, using Parcel for the build process and SCSS for styling.

Overview

The project structure is as follows:

index.html: The entry point of the application. Contains the basic HTML structure and the root DOM element for the React app.
index.jsx: The primary React file where the application is initialized and components are rendered.
index.scss: SCSS file responsible for styling the application.
Getting Started

Navigate to the project directory.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Start the project with Parcel using parcel src/index.html.

Usage

Build Process
